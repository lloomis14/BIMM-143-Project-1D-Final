# BIMM-143-Project-1D-Final

Files needed for analysis

Scientific Question: By comparing the protein sequences, and the proposed 3D structures, of MAO A, MAO B and zebra fish monoamine oxidases, can the origin of functional differences in the proteins be discovered?

Hypothesis: If the functional differences of MAO A, MAO B and the MAO of the zebra fish is caused by the nucleotide sequences then differences will be observable in the protein sequences and 3D structures leading to differences in binding and activation pockets of these enzymes.

All of the faa files are taken from the NCBI database, and downloaded as amino acid sequences

MAO_A_protein.faa: This is protein coded by the human genome, the file itself includes two different isotypes for this protein
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Db=gene&Cmd=DetailsSearch&Term=4128

MAO_B_protein.faa: Like the MAO A protein above it is a protein coded by the human genomes and the file includes two seperate isotypes
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Db=gene&Cmd=DetailsSearch&Term=4129

zfish_protein.faa: Unlike the two above this is not from the human genome, but instead that of the zebra fish (Danio rerio) which only has one monoamine oxidase.

MAOA_1.pdb: Homology model of isotype 1 from MAO A protein

zfish.pdb:  Homology model of MAO from the zebra fish genome.

Project 2C Final.rmd: The original R notebook file, with the script and graph outputs.

Project 2C Final.nb.html: The knitted html version of the same file.
